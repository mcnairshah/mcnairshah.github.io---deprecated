Hi! I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Before coming to CMU, I lived in Birmingham, Alabama, and was in the Math/Science department at the [Alabama School of Fine Arts](https://www.asfaschool.org/). I'm interested AI, physics, computational neuroscience, math, or generally solving any cool problems (and talking to cool people about them!). In my free time I like to walk, participate in various trivia competitions, read fantasy and science fiction, and sleep. 
I've previously done research on various types of brain imaging data, such as electroencephalogram decoding and human connectome upsampling, as well as large language model interpretability. I currently work on time series foundation models with Artur Dubrawski in the [Auton Lab](https://autonlab.org/) @ CMU.
