Hi! I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Before coming to CMU, I lived in Birmingham, Alabama, and was in the Math/Science department at the [Alabama School of Fine Arts](https://www.asfaschool.org/). I'm interested AI, physics, computational neuroscience, math, or generally solving any cool problems (and talking to cool people about them!). In my free time I like to walk, participate in various trivia competitions, read fantasy and science fiction, and sleep.
