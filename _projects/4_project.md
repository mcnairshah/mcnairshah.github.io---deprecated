[ThingNamer](https://thingnamer-frontend.vercel.app/) (note: may be down as I self-host it) is an interpretability-based app that assigns names to objects by using probes trained for different names on a vision-language model, trying to simulate what 'name vibe' the model gets from the object. Shows consistency in object naming in different pictures. Made for fun, and not meant to be considered as evidence of anything in interpretability.
